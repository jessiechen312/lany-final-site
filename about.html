  <h2>BIO</h2>
  <p>
    LANY is a Los Angeles-based trio comprised of Paul Klein (piano, guitar), Les Priest (keyboards, guitar), Jake Goss (drums.) The band formed in Nashville in 2014 and after relocating to LA shortly thereafter, they released their first set of songs by the end of that year. LANY has since built an incredible following touring across the world and have played over 350 live shows. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2017, which tied for the highest-charting debut album on the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart that year. LANY's music has been streamed over 1 billion times as they continue to sell out venues across the world.

  LANY spent the beginning of 2018 crafting their second album, followed by another headline tour and playing Main Stage at multiple major U.S. festivals – including Coachella, Governors Ball and Bonnaroo – to critical acclaim. Rolling Stone crowned the group's Governors Ball performance as "The Best Stage Presence," and lauded LANY's star power as "out-of-this-world." The band most recently released their sophomore album, Malibu Nights, on October 5 via Interscope Records; the record is filled with euphoric, epic anthems, a captivating coming together of joyous pop hooks and tender ballads, true to their distinguishing musical style. LANY will embark on another World Tour in 2019.
